# LiveQRCode_intro
I put this for study purpose.</b>
Never write a code before...

Only a few month of learning python.

If you find a better way of improving.

Please let me know.

Thank you!

The project is simple.
1. Start up your webcam with openCV.
2. Use pyzbar and openCV to decode the QRcode.
3. Frame the QRcode with text.
4. Print out the data.
5. Store the data into csv.
6. Use google API to upload the reformated data.
